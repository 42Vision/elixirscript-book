# Input

Create a file named `app.exjs`, add the following and then save it:

```elixir
defmodule App do

  def hello() do
    "Hello, World"
  end

  def hello(name) do
    "Hello, #{name}"
  end

end
```

One thing to notice is the file extension. Elixirscript files have `.exjs` as their file extension.

Next, we will compile our file and look at the output.
